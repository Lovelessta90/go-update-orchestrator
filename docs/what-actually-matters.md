# What Actually Matters: A Practical Guide

## TL;DR

**In production, optimize these (in order):**

1. **Algorithms** - O(n²) → O(n) gives 100x improvement
2. **Concurrency** - 10 → 100 concurrent = 10x throughput
3. **Memory** - Prevents OOM crashes (infinite improvement!)
4. **Database/Network** - Batch operations, reduce round-trips
5. **User Experience** - Progress bars, cancellation, retry

**Don't optimize:**
- Micro-optimizations (<5% gain)
- Things that aren't bottlenecks
- Code that's not hot path

---

## The Rule of 5%

**Only optimize if it improves user-facing metrics by >5%**

User-facing metrics:
- ✓ Time to complete update
- ✓ Devices updated per minute
- ✓ Memory usage (prevents crashes)
- ❌ Allocations per operation (user doesn't see this)
- ❌ Microseconds saved (user doesn't notice)

---

## Real-World Optimization Priorities

### Priority 1: Don't Crash (Memory)

**Problem**: Loading 1GB firmware file into memory
```go
// BAD: Crashes on large files
data, _ := os.ReadFile("firmware.bin")  // BOOM! Out of memory
http.Post(url, bytes.NewReader(data))
```

**Solution**: Stream it
```go
// GOOD: Constant memory usage
f, _ := os.Open("firmware.bin")
defer f.Close()
http.Post(url, f)  // Streams, uses ~8KB
```

**Impact**: Infinite (doesn't crash vs crashes)

---

### Priority 2: Algorithms (Big-O)

**Problem**: Finding devices by tag (O(n) per device)
```go
// BAD: O(n²) - Check each device against each filter
for _, device := range allDevices {
    matches := true
    for k, v := range filter.Tags {
        if device.Metadata[k] != v {
            matches = false
        }
    }
}
```

**Solution**: Index by tags (O(1) per device)
```go
// GOOD: O(n) - Build index once, lookup is O(1)
type Registry struct {
    devicesByTag map[string][]string  // tag -> deviceIDs
}

func (r *Registry) FindByTag(tag string) []Device {
    ids := r.devicesByTag[tag]  // O(1) lookup
    // ... return devices
}
```

**Impact**:
- 10 devices: 10ms → 1ms (10x faster)
- 100 devices: 100ms → 1ms (100x faster)
- 10K devices: 10 seconds → 1ms (10,000x faster)

---

### Priority 3: Concurrency (Throughput)

**Problem**: Updating devices one at a time
```go
// BAD: Serial execution
for _, device := range devices {
    updateDevice(device)  // 50ms each
}
// 10 devices = 500ms
// 100 devices = 5 seconds
// 10K devices = 8 minutes!
```

**Solution**: Update concurrently
```go
// GOOD: Bounded concurrency
pool := NewWorkerPool(100)  // 100 concurrent
for _, device := range devices {
    pool.Submit(func() {
        updateDevice(device)
    })
}
// 10K devices with 100 concurrent = 5 seconds (100x faster!)
```

**Impact**: 100x improvement for large fleets

---

### Priority 4: Network/Database (Round-trips)

**Problem**: N+1 query problem
```go
// BAD: 10,001 database queries
devices := db.GetAllDevices()  // 1 query
for _, device := range devices {
    status := db.GetStatus(device.ID)  // 10,000 queries!
}
```

**Solution**: Batch fetch
```go
// GOOD: 2 database queries
devices := db.GetAllDevices()     // 1 query
statuses := db.GetAllStatuses()   // 1 query (batch)
```

**Impact**:
- Database round-trip: 1ms
- 10,001 queries: 10 seconds
- 2 queries: 2ms
- **Improvement: 5,000x faster**

---

### Priority 5: User Experience

**Problem**: No progress indication
```go
// BAD: User stares at blank screen
for _, device := range 10000_devices {
    updateDevice(device)  // Takes 10 minutes, no feedback
}
```

**Solution**: Show progress
```go
// GOOD: User sees progress
total := len(devices)
for i, device := range devices {
    updateDevice(device)
    progress := float64(i) / float64(total) * 100
    fmt.Printf("Progress: %.1f%%\r", progress)
}
```

**Impact**: Same speed, but **feels 10x faster** to user

---

## What NOT to Optimize

### ❌ Micro-Optimization: Buffer Pooling

**Reality check:**
```go
// "Optimization": Use sync.Pool for buffers
var pool = sync.Pool{...}

// Saves: 15 allocations, 2KB memory
// On a 50ms network request
// User sees: 0.03% faster
// Worth it? NO (unless doing millions/sec)
```

**When it matters:**
- High-frequency operation (millions/sec)
- Hot path in tight loop
- After profiling shows it's a bottleneck

**This project:** Updates happen every few hours, buffer pooling saves nothing.

---

### ❌ String Interning

**Reality check:**
```go
// "Optimization": Intern header strings
var headers = map[string]string{
    "content-type": "Content-Type",
}

// Saves: 10 allocations
// On a 50ms network request
// User sees: 0.01% faster
// Worth it? NO
```

**When it matters:**
- Parsing millions of strings
- High-memory application
- Profiler shows string allocations are hot

**This project:** We send a few HTTP headers, string interning is pointless.

---

### ❌ Pre-allocating Slices

**Reality check:**
```go
// "Optimization": Pre-allocate slice
devices := make([]Device, 0, expectedSize)

// Saves: 5 allocations
// In a function called once per update
// User sees: 0.001% faster
// Worth it? NO (unless in tight loop)
```

**When it matters:**
- Tight loop (called millions of times)
- Known size at compile time
- Profiler shows slice growth is hot

**This project:** Device list is fetched once per update, pre-allocation saves nothing.

---

## Realistic Optimization Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Updating 10K Devices

**Current implementation (serial):**
```
10,000 devices × 50ms each = 500 seconds (8 minutes)
```

**Optimization: Concurrency**
```
10,000 devices ÷ 100 concurrent = 100 batches
100 batches × 50ms = 5 seconds
```

**Improvement: 100x faster (8 min → 5 sec)**

---

### Scenario 2: Memory Usage

**Current implementation (loading files):**
```
1GB firmware file × 100 concurrent updates = 100GB RAM needed
```

**Optimization: Streaming**
```
8KB buffer × 100 concurrent = 0.8MB RAM needed
```

**Improvement: 125,000x less memory (doesn't crash!)**

---

### Scenario 3: Device Lookup

**Current implementation (linear scan):**
```
10,000 devices × 1μs per check = 10ms per lookup
1,000 lookups = 10 seconds
```

**Optimization: Map-based lookup**
```
Map[deviceID] → O(1) = 1μs per lookup
1,000 lookups = 1ms
```

**Improvement: 10,000x faster (10s → 1ms)**

---

## Measuring What Matters

### Good Metrics (User-Facing)

```bash
# Time to update all devices
time ./orchestrator update --all

# Throughput
devices_per_second = total_devices / total_time

# Memory usage
/usr/bin/time -v ./orchestrator update --all | grep "Maximum resident"

# Success rate
success_rate = completed / total * 100
```

### Bad Metrics (Not User-Facing)

```bash
# Allocations per operation (user doesn't care)
go test -bench=. -benchmem

# Microseconds per HTTP request (network dominates)
# Unless you're doing millions per second
```

---

## Decision Framework

Before optimizing, ask:

1. **Is this a bottleneck?**
   - Profile first: `go tool pprof cpu.prof`
   - If function uses <5% CPU, skip it

2. **What's the user-facing impact?**
   - Calculate: (time_saved / total_time) × 100
   - If <5%, skip it

3. **What's the complexity cost?**
   - Simple code > fast code
   - Can future developers understand it?

4. **Can I measure the improvement?**
   - Before/after benchmarks
   - Real-world testing

5. **What breaks if I'm wrong?**
   - Tests still pass?
   - Edge cases handled?

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Worth Optimizing

**Situation**: Device registry lookup is O(n)
```
Profile shows: 40% of CPU time in FindDevice()
10,000 devices, called 1,000 times per update
Total time: 60 seconds per update
```

**Optimization**: Add map-based index
```go
type Registry struct {
    devices   []Device
    deviceMap map[string]*Device  // O(1) lookup
}
```

**Impact**:
- CPU time: 40% → 1% (39% saved)
- Total time: 60s → 36s (40% faster)
- User sees: **24 seconds saved**

**Worth it?** YES! (40% user-facing improvement)

---

### Example 2: NOT Worth Optimizing

**Situation**: HTTP headers allocate strings
```
Profile shows: 0.5% of CPU time in header allocation
Total time: 60 seconds per update
```

**Optimization**: String interning
```go
var headerPool = map[string]string{...}
```

**Impact**:
- CPU time: 0.5% → 0.4% (0.1% saved)
- Total time: 60s → 59.94s (0.1% faster)
- User sees: **0.06 seconds saved**

**Worth it?** NO! (0.1% improvement, adds complexity)

---

## Summary

### Optimize (in order):
1. **Algorithms** - Fix O(n²), use proper data structures
2. **Concurrency** - Parallelize independent work
3. **Memory** - Stream instead of load, prevent leaks
4. **I/O** - Batch operations, reduce round-trips
5. **UX** - Progress, cancellation, retry

### Don't Optimize:
- Allocations (unless causing OOM)
- Microseconds (unless doing millions/sec)
- Non-bottlenecks (profile first!)
- Anything <5% user-facing impact

### Remember:

## Next Steps

1. Profile your actual workload: `go tool pprof cpu.prof`
2. Find the **top 3 functions** by time
3. Ask: "Can I make this O(n) instead of O(n²)?"
4. Ask: "Can I parallelize this?"
5. Optimize those, ignore everything else
