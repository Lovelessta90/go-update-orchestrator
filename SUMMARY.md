## Learning Resources Included

### Spotting "Vibe Code"
The performance guide ([docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md)) shows 5 common anti-patterns:

1. **String concatenation in loops** → Use strings.Builder
2. **Unbounded goroutines** → Use worker pools
3. **Loading entire files** → Use streaming
4. **Not reusing HTTP clients** → Use connection pooling
5. **Allocating in hot paths** → Use sync.Pool

### Measuring Performance
Step-by-step guides for:
- Running benchmarks
- CPU profiling (`go tool pprof`)
- Memory profiling
- Comparing results (`benchstat`)
- Interpreting data

### Optimization Workflow
```
1. Profile (find hotspots)
2. Optimize (one change)
3. Benchmark (measure)
4. Compare (verify improvement)
5. Document (track progress)
```

## Quick Commands

### Run Benchmarks
```bash
make bench                # Quick benchmark
make bench-baseline       # Save baseline (3s runs)
make bench-compare        # Compare vs baseline
```

### Profile Performance
```bash
# CPU profiling
go test -bench=BenchmarkPush -cpuprofile=cpu.prof ./pkg/delivery/http/
go tool pprof -http=:8080 cpu.prof

# Memory profiling
go test -bench=BenchmarkPush -memprofile=mem.prof ./pkg/delivery/http/
go tool pprof -http=:8080 mem.prof
```

### Compare Optimizations
```bash
# Before
go test -bench=. -benchmem -count=10 ./pkg/delivery/http/ > before.txt

# Make changes...

# After
go test -bench=. -benchmem -count=10 ./pkg/delivery/http/ > after.txt

# Compare
benchstat before.txt after.txt
```

## What's Next

### Immediate (Phase 1, Part 2)
1. **Progress Tracker** - Real-time update monitoring
2. **Orchestrator Core** - Main coordination logic
3. **End-to-End POS Example** - All scenarios working

### Future Optimizations
Based on baseline analysis, you can:
1. Implement buffer pooling (est. -20% allocations)
2. Add string interning (est. -15% allocations)
3. Tune connection pooling (est. -10% latency)
4. Optimize header handling (est. -10 allocations)

**Target**: 35-40 μs/op, 5-5.5 KB/op, 50-60 allocs/op

## Final Notes

This codebase is a **functional baseline**, not a final product. It's designed to:

1. ✅ Work correctly (all tests pass)
2. ✅ Be measurable (comprehensive benchmarks)
3. ✅ Be optimizable (clear targets identified)
4. ✅ Teach optimization (extensive documentation)

**Your Goal**: Learn to spot inefficiencies and measure improvements

**Next Step**: Read [BASELINE_METRICS.md](BASELINE_METRICS.md) and start profiling!
