---

## What's Been Built

### 1. Complete File Structure ✓

- **24 Go source files** across 30 directories
- **Organized by component**: cmd, pkg, internal, testing, examples, docs
- **Interface-based design**: All major components use interfaces
- **Working builds**: Both CLI and server compile successfully

### 2. Core Type System ✓

**Device Model** ([pkg/core/device.go](pkg/core/device.go))
- Device with connectivity status (online/offline/unknown)
- Last seen timestamp tracking
- Firmware version tracking
- Location and metadata support
- Rich filtering capabilities

**Update Model** ([pkg/core/update.go](pkg/core/update.go))
- Four update strategies:
  - `Immediate` - Push to online devices now
  - `Scheduled` - Execute at specific time/window
  - `Progressive` - Gradual rollout in phases
  - `OnConnect` - Update when device connects
- Rollout phases with success thresholds
- Device filtering for targeted updates

### 3. Component Interfaces ✓

All major components have well-defined interfaces:

- **Delivery** - Protocol-agnostic update delivery
- **Registry** - Device storage and retrieval
- **Scheduler** - Update scheduling and execution
- **Progress Tracker** - Progress monitoring and estimation
- **Event Bus** - Event publishing and subscription

### 4. Working Implementations ✓

**Memory Registry** ([pkg/registry/memory/memory.go](pkg/registry/memory/memory.go))
- Fully functional in-memory device storage
- Complete filter implementation:
  - Status (online/offline)
  - Location
  - Tags/metadata
  - Last seen timestamps
  - Pagination support

**Event System** ([pkg/events/](pkg/events/))
- Working pub/sub event bus
- Event types for all lifecycle events
- Handler interface with function adapter

**Internal Utilities** ([internal/](internal/))
- Worker pool for bounded concurrency
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Buffer pool for streaming efficiency
- Input validation helpers

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation ✓

**README.md**

- Architecture diagram
- Development commands

**Architecture Documentation** ([docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md))
- Component diagram and data flow
- Design decisions and rationale
- Performance characteristics
- Extension points

**Interface Contracts** ([docs/interfaces.md](docs/interfaces.md))

### 6. POS System Example ✓

**Working Example** ([examples/pos_system/](examples/pos_system/))

Demonstrates **6 real-world scenarios**:

1. **Immediate Update** - Critical security patch to online devices
2. **Scheduled Window** - Firmware update during 2 AM - 4 AM maintenance window
3. **Progressive Rollout** - Canary → 50% → 100% with success thresholds
4. **On-Connect Strategy** - Updates for intermittently connected devices
5. **Region-Based Update** - Target specific geographic regions
6. **Firmware Upgrade** - Update devices running old firmware versions

**Sample Data**:
- 10 realistic POS devices across U.S. locations
- Mix of online/offline/unknown status
- Different firmware versions
- Rich metadata (region, priority, store type)

**Output**:
```bash
cd examples/pos_system && go run main.go
```
Shows detailed execution plans for each scenario with device-by-device breakdown.

## Answered Questions

### "How do companies manage 10K vehicles when they're not always connected?"

**Answer**: Companies maintain a **FULL REGISTRY** of all devices (even offline) and use multiple strategies:

1. **Immediate push** to online devices (e.g., 7,000 of 10,000)
2. **Queue updates** for offline devices (e.g., 3,000)
3. **On-connect delivery** when offline devices reconnect
4. **Scheduled windows** for predictable connectivity (e.g., 2 AM)
5. **Progressive rollout** for risk mitigation

See [docs/device-management.md](docs/device-management.md) for complete details.

### Key Insights from Research

**Connectivity Patterns**:
- Fleet vehicles: 50-70% online at any time
- POS systems: 90%+ online during business hours
- IoT sensors: 20-40% online (battery-powered)
- Digital signage: 95%+ online (wired)

**Common Practice**:
- Maintain registry of ALL devices (not just online)
- Track last seen timestamp
- Heartbeat every 5 minutes (when connected)
- Multi-strategy approach (immediate + scheduled + on-connect)
